# Hosting

We're gonna use a few things for hosting, all of which _should_ be pretty straightforward!

Since we have three things to host (frontend, backend, database), we are going to use three platforms (you can break things up differently if you want!).

## Frontend

We will use vercel to deploy our frontend. It's a super simple registration process (just register with gihub and give it access to your repos), and then import a git repository that you want hosted. 🥰
