# Introduction

We are going to be using [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), which is a framework _on top_ of [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) that gives some niceties here and there. Effectively we will be writing Vue though.

## What is Vue

Vue is a javascript framework for creating Single Page Applications (SPAs)â€”or frontend web applications in general. This has benefits of things like routing, reactivity, state management, etc. Essentially, the goal of frameworks are to ease the pains of creating web applications with vanilla javascript.

Nuxt then is sort of a meta-framework and seeks to ease some of the pains of creating web applications with _Vue_. Some of this is with static site generation, file-structure based routing, automatic code splitting, etc (feel free to read up on it on their site!).
